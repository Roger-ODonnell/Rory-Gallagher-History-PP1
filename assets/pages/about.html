          <h3>Early Days:</h3>
          <p>
            Rory was born to Daniel and Monica Gallagher in Ballyshannon, County
            Donegal, Ireland, in 1948. In 1956, Gallagher, his mother, and his
            brother moved to Cork, where Gallagher attended North Monastery
            School. Gallagher displayed musical aptitude at an early age. He
            taught himself how to play the ukulele, and received a guitar from
            his parents at age nine. He began performing at minor functions, and
            won a cash prize in a talent contest when he was twelve that he used
            to buy a new guitar. Three years later, in 1963, he purchased a 1961
            Fender Stratocaster for Â£100. This guitar became his primary
            instrument and was most associated with him during his career.

          <h3>Taste</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/The_Taste_1970.jpg">
          <p>Taste (originally "The Taste") was formed in Cork, Ireland, in August 1966 as a trio consisting of Rory Gallagher on guitars and vocals, Eric Kitteringham on bass, and Norman Damery on drums. 
            In their early years Taste toured in Hamburg and Ireland before becoming regulars at Maritime Hotel, an R&B club in Belfast, Northern Ireland, in the summer of 1967.</p>
            <p>They performed at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970, alongside Jimi Hendrix and The Who. According to Donal Gallagher (Rory's brother who managed the band) filmmaker Murray Lerner had instructed his crew to shoot just two numbers from the new bands and to save the main film stock for Jimi Hendrix, The Who, Leonard Cohen and the other headliners, but Taste's performance prompted him to change his instructions: "Murray didn't know who Taste were but when he saw the spontaneity of the band and the audience and their interaction, he just told his guys keep filming and they just kept going and captured over an hour of the performance which was quite incredible." 
              In the song "Sugar Mama", a photographer can be seen hurriedly bringing his camera up from a re-load to cover another camera angle.</p>

          <h3>Rory Gallagher Solo Career</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/Brendan-Rory-Gerry-mixing-desk-jinx2-web-optimised-1000-1.webp">
          <p>After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy to play on Gallagher's self-titled debut album, Rory Gallagher.

            It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy; the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell. The 1970s were Gallagher's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live! in Europe and Irish Tour '74. November 1971 saw the release of the album Deuce.
            
            In 1972, he was voted Melody Maker's Guitarist/Musician of the Year.
            However, despite a number of his albums from this period reaching the UK Albums Chart, Gallagher did not attain major star status.</p>

          <h3>Final Days</h3>
          <img src="/assets/images/Rory-1995.jpg">
          <p>Rory literally played until he dropped, after collapsing onstage in Rotterdam in January 1995, 
            he was hospitalised in London with liver failure. 
            Following a successful transplant operation he seemed to be recovering, but he caught an infection and died in June 1995.</p>
