        <h2>Rory Gallagher Band</h2>
        <img src="/assets/images/rory band.jpg">
        <p>Rory Gallagher's band consisted of a couple members over the years, main ones to note are Gerry Mcavoy, Rorys bassist from the 70's up to the late 80s and 90s, 
          Ted Mckenna the drummer who was with rory for a long portion along with brendan O'Neil and Rod De'Ath.</p>

          <p>After the break-up of Taste, Gallagher toured under his own name, hiring former Deep Joy bass player Gerry McAvoy to play on Gallagher's self-titled debut album, Rory Gallagher.

            It was the beginning of a twenty-year musical relationship between Gallagher and McAvoy; the other band member was drummer Wilgar Campbell.The 1970s were Gallagher's most prolific period. He produced ten albums in that decade, including two live albums, Live! in Europe and Irish Tour '74. November 1971 saw the release of the album Deuce.</p>
            <p>
              Gallagher collaborated with Jerry Lee Lewis and Muddy Waters on their respective London Sessions in the mid-1970s. He played on Lonnie Donegan's 1978 album Puttin' on the Style.
              In the 1980s he continued recording, producing Jinx, Defender, and Fresh Evidence. After Fresh Evidence, he embarked on a tour of the United States. In addition he played with Box of Frogs, a band formed in 1983 by former members of The Yardbirds. Becoming obsessive over details and plagued by self-doubt, Gallagher nevertheless retained a loyal fanbase. During this period he stated "I agonize too much".
