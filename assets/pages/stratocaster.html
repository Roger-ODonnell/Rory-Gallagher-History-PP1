            Rorys iconic 1961 Fender Stratocaster. Rory bought this guitar for
            £100 in 1963 on credit from the owner of Crowleys Music Store in
            Cork, Michael Crowley. According to the legend, this was the first
            Stratocaster to ever reach Ireland. The story of how Rory came to
            own his 1961 Fender Stratocaster is somewhat interesting in itself.
            The guitars previous owner was Jim Conlon, who is known for being
            the founder and the guitarist of an Irish band called Royal
            Showband. Jim allegedly ordered a red Stratocaster from the US but
            this sunburst came instead, so he had to use the guitar for around
            half a year until the red one would arrive. After the red Strat
            finally got to Ireland, the sunburst was put on sale at Michael
            Crowleys store, who eventually met Rory and agreed to sell the
            guitar to him in installments.

            The guitar as seen has intensive wear and although disregarded by
            most, a factor that might have also played a role in this was that
            the guitar was left in a rainy ditch for days at some point in 1966.
            A few days prior to this, Rorys Strat was stolen from him during
            alongside a Telecaster that he borrowed from a friend to use as a
            slide guitar for the upcoming gig in Dublin. Rory decided to contact
            the producers of the television show called “Garda Patrol”, who then
            featured the guitar in one their segments that supposedly revolved
            around helping people locate their lost stuff. A few days passed and
            the guitar was found abandoned in a ditch, and following that was
            successfully returned to Rory who swore never to lose sight of it
            again.
